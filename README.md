# Student-PickUp-Management
# Overview
My project will allow Teacher to create account, add all their students of her class and pickup information.At the end of the day Teacher can view the list of all her students on Projector and form lines based on their pickup type and disperse kids to specified pikcup location.

Potential future features would include 
a)School administration to maintain the students pickup information.Administration can create account for all their front office staff, and teachers. Administration has to specify Access Id ,Access Password for each grade,so parents can create account for their kids.
b)Parents can create an account using the information provided by School Administration, add their kids to account and set the pickup type of kids, can change the pickup type and even view how their kid is going by.
c) Sending mails to parents on first day of school specifying the location to pick their kids up and whenever parents choose different way update them with new pickup location.
d) Include more schools from the county and more counties.
e)Include Google Maps location to show the exact location , and safe drive way around school.
